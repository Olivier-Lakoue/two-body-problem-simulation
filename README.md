# Two body problem simulation
Simulation of the classical two-body problem in the context of the earth and artificial satellites.

## Context this project
- This program was made as a result of my fourth year project work in Astronomy.

## Study
- [Orbital mechanics](http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm)
- [TLE](http://www.stltracker.com/resources/tle)

## Simulation Equations
- Considering a bodies in such condtions below;

- Then we are able to define `R` and `V`.

### R, the position from the primary body of the orbiting body

### V, the orbiting body's velocity

## Dependecies
- numpy
- scipy
- turtle
- matplotlib
