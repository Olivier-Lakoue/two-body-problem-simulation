    \textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}
The two body problem in physics involves two masses that are bound to each other by gravitation. The problem is to describe all subsequent velocities and positions of the masses given the initial velocity and positions of the two bodies. Two body solutions will help us in predicting the motion of satellites and we will come up with a simulation to predict future movements.
