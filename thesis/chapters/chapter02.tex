\section{Two body problem}
The problem of motion of bodies relative to each other has long been studied. However it's only until recently that researchers have been able to use the full power of computers to research on these problems. In this project we will  leverage on the research that has been done on n-body problems specifically the two-body problems. The two body problem is able to be solved exactly reproducing the Kepler laws.
Johannes Kepler 1571 to 1630 was able to formulate laws that described the data gathered by Tycho Brahe. These laws were largely empirical. Isaac newton who came after him was able to formulate the laws that  govern motion. Joseph lagrange was able to make these equations more detailed. For this project we will focus on the two body problem. The two body problem states that given two bodies with velocities and masses at a given time,t, seperated by a distance, r, find consecutive values for the v and r henceforth.
